**Project Plan: Real-time Financial News & Sentiment Analysis Agent**

**Date:** Monday, April 21, 2025
**Time:** 10:49:11 AM CDT
**Location:** Aurora, Illinois, United States

**Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Configuration**

1.  **Initialize Project:** Set up directory, Python virtual environment, Git repository, and `.gitignore`.
2.  **Define Basic Structure:** Create standard project directories (`src`, `tests`, `config`, `data`) and main script file.
3.  **Configuration Management:** Implement method (e.g., `.env`, YAML) for managing API keys and settings; include example file and loader script.
4.  **Install Core Dependencies:** Install base libraries (`requests`, `langchain`/LLM client, `asyncio`, config loader) and generate `requirements.txt`.
5.  **Setup Logging:** Configure standard Python logging for console and file output with appropriate levels.

**Phase 2: Data Acquisition Layer (Real-time Feeds)**

6.  **Watchlist Management:** Implement module/class to load and manage user-defined stock symbols/sectors from configuration.
7.  **News API Client:** Implement async module to connect to real-time News API(s), handle authentication, and stream/fetch news for watchlist symbols.
8.  **Social Media API Client:** Implement async module to connect to real-time Social Media API(s), handle authentication, and stream posts for watchlist symbols/cashtags.
9.  **Data Filtering:** Implement logic to filter incoming data streams based on the active watchlist.

**Phase 3: Data Processing & AI Integration**

10. **LLM Service Integration:** Create module to interact with the chosen LLM API, handling prompts and API calls for various processing tasks.
11. **Implement Summarization:** Develop function using LLM to generate concise summaries of financial news/text.
12. **Implement Sentiment Analysis:** Develop function using LLM specifically trained/prompted for financial sentiment analysis (Positive/Negative/Neutral).
13. **Implement Topic Extraction:** Develop function using LLM to identify the main financial event/topic in the text.
14. **Implement Anomaly Detection (Basic):** Add logic to track baseline sentiment/volume per symbol and flag significant deviations.

**Phase 4: Agent Core Logic & Orchestration**

15. **Develop Main Agent Loop:** Implement the main asynchronous (`asyncio`) loop to manage data fetchers, task queues (if needed), filtering, processing dispatch, and result handling.
16. **Integrate Processing Steps:** Ensure the agent loop correctly orchestrates the calls to summarization, sentiment, topic, and anomaly detection functions.

---

**Phase 5: Alerting & Output**

17. **Implement Alerting Service:** Create module with functions to send notifications via configured channels (e.g., Email, Slack, Discord).
18. **Trigger Alerts:** Integrate alerting calls into the agent logic based on predefined conditions (e.g., sentiment thresholds, anomalies).
19. **Implement Basic Output/Storage:** Define initial strategy for viewing results (e.g., structured console logging, saving to file).

---

**Phase 6: Storage, Testing & Deployment**

20. **Implement Persistent Storage (Optional):** Set up and integrate a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for storing processed news items and sentiment data.
21. **Write Unit Tests:** Develop unit tests using `unittest` or `pytest` for key modules, mocking external dependencies.
22. **Write Integration Tests:** Create tests to verify the end-to-end flow of data through core parts of the agent.
23. **Containerize with Docker:** Create a `Dockerfile` to package the application and its dependencies.
24. **Deployment Strategy:** Plan and document the steps for deploying the containerized application to the target environment.
